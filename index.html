          <p><i><strong>Business Analyst,</strong> Atlantic City Electric</i></p>
          <p>I began my professional career with Atlantic City Electric in January 2014.
            I started as a Billing Specialist in the back office section, of the
            billing department. From there, I moved to Orders Processing. After 4 years
            in Orders Processing I was promoted to management and joined the NEM
            (Net Energy Metering) team. Here I became a Business Analyst and took on
            additional roles and responsibilities. For more information, about my tasks and
            responsibilities, please visit my
